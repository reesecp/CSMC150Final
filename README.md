# CSMC150Final

This game, a final project for CSMC150, is designed to help people get familiar with identifying 17 island countires that may escape their memory during trivia, worldle, or the olympics. The player is prompted with a country's capital and, later, the body of water in which it lies. the player given the chance to guess the country after each prompt and earns more points for only needing one.
To create this project I made a class dedicated to the Island class with attributes for the each island countries name, capital, and surrounding body of water. My Island client (GameIsland) constructs the 17 different island objects for each country and includes the code necessary for game play.
No outside datasets, modules, or tools were used. Though I did use wikipedia for a list of ilsand countries and information on their capitals and surrounding bodies of water.
To use this game, clone the this project, compile the java files, and run GameIsland.
