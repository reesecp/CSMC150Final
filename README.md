# CSMC150Final
Final Project for CSMC150

I want to create a game for guessing the name of an island country (originally, I wanted to do all the countries, but that seemed like an unnecessarily repetitive task). The program will display an image of the island nation in silhouette. The player will have 3 chances to guess and 7 seconds between each guess. After having five seconds with the image of the nation's territory in silhouette, if the player hasn't entered the correct name, the program will give a second hint (the country's capital) and another chance to guess. If needed, a third hint (the ocean(s) the country is in) and an additional chances will be given to guess. The less hints are given (or, equivalently the less 7 second intervals have passed), the more points the user will receive for guessing correctly. I don't think I'll need any external packages. For data, however, I'll need images of the the countries and I'll have to figure out how to display those. I'll also need to figure out how to time the hints/ delay the printing. Maybe the sleep method of the thread package form java.lang will work for that?
